# Capacity-Optimization-for-Celluar-Network
## Based on python and Machine Learning classification algorithms [ Sklearn, Matplotlib, Mpl-toolkits, Pandas, Numpy]
The objective in this project is to develop a method to detect the problems for cellular network in (3G,4G) Then recommend solutions for each of these problems to increase capacity.

### Note:
This project is implemented based on huawei vendor counters from dataset which is not available for public.
