# Capacity-Optimization-for-Celluar-Network
## Based on 
python libraries and Machine Learning classification algorithms [ Sklearn, Matplotlib, Mpl-toolkits, Pandas, Numpy]
### Describtion:
The objective in this project is to develop a method to detect the problems for cellular network in (3G,4G) Then recommend solutions for each of these problems to increase capacity.

#### Note:
This project is implemented based on huawei vendor counters from dataset which is not available for public.
